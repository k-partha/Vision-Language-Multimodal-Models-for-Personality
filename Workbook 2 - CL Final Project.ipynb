Week - 8 - Deep Neural Nets and Text - Training Models\n","\n","In this week we will be introduced to using Deep Neural Networks to work with text. We have already seen some uses of neural networks for text in our classification HW, where we used a simple neural network to classify text - it performs quite well, but they can come up short in more sophisticated classification tasks, such as in predicting intent. We have also seen neural nets in the form of word embeddings such as Word2Vec - and while they certainly work well, they have some drawbacks, such as dealing with words with multiple meanings. \n","\n","BERT, which is a language model built using bidirectional encoders, allows us to have a powerful pre-trained model which we can then use to perform our own tasks based on the data we are analysing. \n","\n","In this notebook we will use ```huggingface/transformers```, which is a python package which allows for an easy interface to use pre-trained BERT models. It is built using Tensorflow and PyTorch, two computational graph packages which are built specifically for creating powerful neural networks. We will also be introducing Keras, which allows us to easily build Neural Networks in an abstracted way. Keras is a popular way to understand how we can stack layers to create such Neural Networks, though to reach state-of-the-art results we will stick with using BERT and similar models.\n","\n","To demonstrate this, we will use the [Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/). We will also be using BERT by learning how to extract embeddings from such a model and use it to semantically probe sentences.\n","There are a bunch of new packages and methods we will be using so be sure to update lucem_illud_2020.\n","\n","Note that this notebook is different to take advantage of the GPU here. We only run the GPU heavy tasks here, where we need models to be fine-tuned.\n","\n","The first section contains the CoLA classification task, the second contains training a model on Trump tweets, and the last bit has us training a model on US and UK blog posts.\n","\n","To switch on your GPU, go to edit -> notebook settings -> hardware accelerator -> enable
